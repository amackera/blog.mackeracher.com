I'm Anson, a recent graduate from the <a title="University of Waterloo" href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>'s <a title="Computer Engineering" href="http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/Undergrad/Q/">Computer Engineering</a> program. I currently live and hack in Waterloo, Ontario. I work for the very radical <a title="Top Hat Monocle" href="http://tophatmonocle.com" target="_blank">Top Hat Monocle</a> company, where I mostly code in JavaScript and C++.

I enjoy learning about a wide range of things from the philosophy of mind to open source device drivers. An avid GNU/Linux user and enthusiast, I enjoy working with (and contributing to!) open source software.
<p style="text-align: left;">I am also a voracious reader. Much of my spare time is spend nose deep in a delicious novel. I like to spend my spare cycles reading through particularly influential writers and thinkers such as Plato, Mary Shelley, Donald Knuth, Homer, Richard Dawkins, and Howard Zinn among many, many others.</p>
