I do a lot of reading and like many hackers the books I read tend to come from all different genres and eras. I don't claim to have any profound ability to find good literature, but occasionally in my word wanderings I stumble upon a mind-blowing book which alters the way in which I view the world. Hopefully some kindred spirits will find my annotated list and be encouraged to borrow these books from their library and get reading!

<em>Disclaimer</em>: The order of this list is <em>not</em> indicative of their precedence!
<h3><em>Siddhartha</em> by Hermann Hesse</h3>
<em>Siddhartha </em>perhaps deserves first place (in a list which I <em>just </em>told you had no order!) since it has so profoundly changed my thinking. The short book depicts the spiritual journey and life of a man living in India at the time of the Buddha. Hermann Hesse's words struck such a chord that even after two years this book resonates within my thoughts and actions.
<h3><em>Godel Escher &amp; Bach</em> by Douglas Hofstadter</h3>
GEB, as it's affectionately called by its fans, is a fascinating romp though the peculiarities of the universe. It is told through a strange sort of partially dialectic, partially ordinary style. Hofstadter's love of language, words, riddles, and double-meanings shines though in some of the particularly involved puzzles subtly sprinkled throughout the pages of this tome. I recommend this book to any curious individual (not for the faint of heart!).
<h3><em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> by Donald Knuth</h3>
How can any hacker's library be complete without these wonderful manuals by the inventor of 'Big O' himself, Donald Knuth. The elegance of the intellect behind these books is evident from, among many things, the meticulous typography, the exercises, and of course the majestic content of the book itself.
<h3><em>I, Robot</em> by Isaac Asimov</h3>
Science fiction literature was irrevocably changed by the publishing of <em>I, Robot</em> by Isaac Asimov. Previously the artificial intelligent beings would be wooden, perfectly obeying slaves to their carbon-based masters; however, <em>I, Robot</em> explored the concept of robots developing a personality, a soul even. In reality, I think, <em>I, Robot</em> is less about robot psychology and more about examining human psychology through the mirror of our own creation, but the concept that A.I could one day be as powerful, or more powerful, than man has stuck. <em>I, Robot</em> is absolutely required reading for any science fiction fan.
<h3><em>A People's History of the United States </em>by Howard Zinn</h3>
What a masterpiece! This book hit me at a cynical time in my life, fresh off the 2nd Bush election, where my world-view was being ransacked by consistently contrary evidence to my optimism. <em>A People's History</em> did nothing to alleviate these misgivings, and indeed reinforced my completely cynical outlook on life! In <em>A People's History</em>, Howard Zinn presents a history not from the perspective of generals and presidents, but from striking miners, starving farmers, blacks fighting for their rights, women fighting for equality. The anecdotal evidence may be skewed, but the recurring themes are almost impossible to ignore. The new American aristocracy desires something (cotton, farmland, oil), then they posture America into a position for war, rowl up the population, and send the poor people to die in the name of national duty. It's a disturbing expos√© of the political motivations behind conflict, and the veil pulled over the eyes of the public.
<h3><em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelley</h3>
This book is the ultimate gothic novel. Through <em>Frankenstein</em>, Shelley examines the power within man to produce his own destroyer. We arrogantly pursue our desires with no thought to their consequences, and what responsibility do we have once we have unleashed our creation onto the world? Does Frankenstein have the right to pursue the creature and destroy it? Does the creature have the right to live its life? Where does a creator's power end over his creation?
<h3><em>Alias Grace </em>by Margaret Atwood</h3>
Though many of my classmates despised this book, I believe it to be an exceptional example of superb creative writing. The great thing about <em>Alias Grace</em> is that each person who reads it could conclude completely different things about the book's happens. This ambiguity touches every aspect of the book, and can have a transformative effect on the person's opinion of its characters. <em>Alias Grace</em> deserves some serious thought after its conclusion.
