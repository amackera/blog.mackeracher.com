Having recently admitted by disillusionment with religion to my (religious) parents, I have been finding myself somewhat lost and lonely. Even though for years I had been questioning my faith, and slowing drawing away from identifying with any religious beliefs, I was still part of a community that knew me and liked me. Now I've cut that part out of my life. It feels strangely empty and liberating. I feel more genuine since I don't have to participate in a sham I don't believe in, but it also feels like I've turned my back on something, well, <em>sacred</em>.

Today I learned of the <a title="The Brights' Net" href="http://www.the-brights.net/movement/">Brights</a> movement. The movement is for people with a worldview "free of supernatural and mystical forces." Some heavyweight, vocal intellectuals whom I admire are said to be supporters of the movement (Daniel Dennet, Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, among others).

I am glad there is a movement for rational, clear thinkers who possess no room for mysticism in their hearts. I am proud to identify with this movement. Today I call myself a Bright!
