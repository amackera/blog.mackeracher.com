If you search for "<a title="Google search for &quot;brain computer analogy&quot;" href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=brain+computer+analogy">brain computer analogy</a>" on Google, you will see, surprisingly, that my <a title="Comments: Whatâ€™s missing from the brain-computer analogy" href="http://thesplitbrain.com/2009/02/09/comments-whats-missing-from-the-brain-computer-analogy/">comments</a> on <a title="Encephalogue on Blogger" href="http://encephalogue.blogspot.com/">Encephalogue</a>'s original <a title="What's missing from the brain-computer analogy" href="http://encephalogue.blogspot.com/2008/12/whats-missing-from-brain-computer.html">ruminations</a> on the topic appear in <em>pretty high up there </em>(currently 5th place). How is it that <em>my lowly conjecture</em> is one of the top Google hits? It boggles me that such a fundamental concept is so underrepresented on the web, so let me remedy that with the following:

The brain-computer analogy (BCA) is simply this: <em>The brain is essentially a computer.</em>
<h3>Aren't computers are made of silicon!?</h3>
The BCA is not saying that brains are made from the same physical materials as your laptop, or even that the brain functions in similar ways to a computer. The analogy is saying that computers and brains to the same job---they <em>compute things</em>. In the words of Paul Thagard:
<blockquote>Here is the central hypothesis of cognitive science: Thinking can best be understood as representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.
<p style="text-align: right;">- Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science, MIT Press, 2005.</p>
</blockquote>
In computers, the representational structures mentioned by Thagard are the structures in the computer's memory, and the computational procedures are the instructions and algorithms used to manipulate those structures. The brain may not have memory that behaves like a computer's RAM, nor does it likely have algorithmic-like instructions, but the analogy simply assumes that <em>however</em> the brain does it, the processes in the brain result in the successful computation of incoming data.
<h3>But I don't feel like a computer!</h3>
Many people have criticised the BCA for a variety of valid reasons. Chris Chatham over at <a title="Develoong Intelligence" href="http://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/">Developing Intelligence blog</a> came up with<a title="10 Important Differences between Brains and Computers" href="http://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2007/03/why_the_brain_is_not_like_a_co.php"> 10 important differences</a> between brains and computers. Chatham's concerns are largely based on taking the analogy too far; that is, when people confuse the physical processes found in computers to be analogous to the physical processes in the brain. Indeed, the ways in which brains appear to process information could not be further from the method by which computer's process information (in terms of the physical processes underlying computation).

For instance computers utilize a simple binary encoding of information whereas the brain's encoding mechanisms are inherently more complex (timing of neuron spikes or rate at which neurons spike). Even further, the information encoding methods employed by the brain can be even more complex than simple scalar values, representing time-varying stimuli, or even functional representations in many dimensions (Anderson, Eliasmith, 2002).

Also neurons are highly complex machines, displaying high degrees of non-linearity in both the encoding process and transformations on encodings. Computer transistors are also complex machines (and inherently non-linear); however, neurons and transistors are <em>nothing alike</em> in form or function.
<h3>Is the analogy a good one?</h3>
What is important in the BCA is not drawing conclusions of the physiology of brain cells or their encoding mechanisms; but rather extending the science of computation into the realm of the brain. If we tear down the analogy between the computer and the brain we pull a mystical veil over the inner workings of the organ. We <em>must</em> work in the context of computation to even begin to understand the processes in the brain.

The analogy may seem overly ambitious to many, but the essence of the analogy still stands, 50 years after the field of Cognitive Science was born.
