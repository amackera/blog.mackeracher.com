I have a confession to make: All day I sit at work and program computers, then after work I go home and do the exact same thing. The programs I write at work and at home are different (right now at work I'm writing a beefy Django app with tons of client-site Backbone JavaScript, but at home I'm learning Rails); but to the untrained eye it must look like I just tap-tap-tap all my free time away.

Of course I wouldn't program in my free time unless I thought it was fun. I pretty much <em>only</em> do things that I think are fun. Life's too short to spend any time being miserable about what you do. Work is a different kind of fun though; work is stressful and high-pressure. We have customers that need features, we have bugs that need fixing <em>yesterday</em>. Those factors that make it stressful are also the factors that make it <em>rewarding.</em> I know that a good publish will make our users happier, and that a bad push will make them sad.

Hacking a Rails app in my spare time is a different beast. Most of my time is spent reading up on best-practices, reading entertaining blog posts by characters in the Rails community, and reading the works of the venerable _why. If I worked at a Rails shop would I still find it as fun? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe that's not the point. I have more freedom to write bullet-proof high-quality code, but if I delay my publish by 2 weeks nobody is going to care (or even notice!).

Does a lawyer finish work at the office and go home to work on slightly different lawyer work? Does a doctor? What about a road-worker, a journalist, a carpenter? I don't think so.

Who does keep working after hours? Artists. Musicians. Writers. Creators.
