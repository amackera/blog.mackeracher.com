I haven't posted on this blog in ages! I have neglected it like many things in my life. Things have been tumultuous for me, these past months, but I've emerged from the chaos and I'm doin' fine.

So I am working at a fantastic Waterloo startup <a title="Top Hat Monocle" href="http://tophatmonocle.com" target="_blank">Top Hat Monocle</a>, and we're launching in September. The bulk of my work is top-secret at this time. We don't want to spoil the punchline too early in the game. Trust me, though, it's badass.

There's not much of a point to this post, just writing for the sake of it. Hope everything is well in whatever you folks are up to!
