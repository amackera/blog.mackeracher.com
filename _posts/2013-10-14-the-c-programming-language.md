This weekend I've started a book that's been on my shelf for ages, but I somehow
haven't found the time to read yet: "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and
Ritchie (also affectionately known as the "little C book", or the "K&R" book). It
covers the C language, it's not quite a manual, but it's short and easy, moves fast
and uses lots of examples.

I'm not a C programmer by any means, but I've written my fair share of C over the
years (especially in university). I've written a real-time OS in C, and an RPC system
that included marshalling and it's own application level protocol (this was a bad idea),
so I know the syntax, and I know how to do things quickly and badly.

I'm reading this book not becaue I want to start writing a ton of C code, but rather
because C is a venerable language by our industry standards and I want to gain an
informed appreciation for it. Who knows, maybe I'll remember why I switched over
to using Python predominantly, or maybe I'll fall in love.

More importantly, I've committed myself to life-long learning. Being a programmer *means*
committing yourself to lifelong learning. Learn about stuff you think you will never use. I
promise you, you will use it. Learn about things you think you're an expert at, and you'll
be suprised at how much there is left to learn! The more I learn, the more I realize my
ignorance, and the more wise and measured I become.

So pick up that crusty Prolog book that's been sitting on your shelf, or read through a
chapter of that Eastern Philosophy book you've been working on, or sit down for an
afternoon and bake a pie with your sister\*. Find the joy in learning.
