uC Hobby has an excellent article on <a title="Programming the Arduino" href="http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2009/02/01/mcu-programming-intro-series-1-sos-on-the-arduino/">programming on the Arduino</a> platform. I have a particular interest in this since I own and program one of this suckers for fun.

Check it out if you're interested in learning about microcontroller programming! The Arduino is a great (and cheap) starting point.
