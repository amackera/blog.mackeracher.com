What's the deal with all the crazy depressed people wandering around in the wasteland in Miguel de Cervantes <em>Don Quixote</em>? There are seriously uncountable numbers of them. If somebody were to go crazy and wander around aimlessly in the wilderness near my hometown in Canada, they would die before they met anybody interesting.

That is all.
