Following a small trend going around in the <a href="http://www.pirateparty.ca/">Pirate Party of Canada</a>'s forums, and specifically Scott Elcomb's <a href="http://psema4.com/blog/libertatia.php/2009/09/10/why-i-became-a-pirate">blog post</a>, I have decided to write a small explanation of why I have elected to become a proud Pirate.

Firstly let me make it clear that by "Pirate" I mean a full-fledged, donating <a href="https://crm.piratepartyofcanada.com/membership_signup.php">member</a> of the Pirate Party of Canada. I have <strong>not</strong> become a Somalian bandit who hijacks shipping vessels. I should also clarify that the views expressed here are my own. They are <strong>not</strong> necessarily reflective of the views and opinions of the Pirate Party of Canada. I do not represent the party in any official capacity.
<h3>Don't Pirates Pillage and Steal?</h3>
Why would anyone become a Pirate? Pirates have a nasty history of stealing, murdering, and other equally nefarious acts. It is precisely because of this history that certain people have branded information theft as piracy. They associate the negative connotations of piracy with the far less severe crime of downloading a song or movie without paying for it. This enhances the argument that information theft crimes should be met with harsher punishments as a deterrent.

The truth of the matter is that the perpetrators of these crimes are people exactly like you and me. They are not hate-filled creatures hijacking Madonna songs on the high seas. People illegally download music because it's convenient, and it's DRM free.

The Pirate Party is taking back the term for the common people accused of these crimes. The powers that be want to brand normal people doing things we all do every day as pirates and criminals. The Pirate Party will take that label and champion it for the very people it was meant to incarcerate.
