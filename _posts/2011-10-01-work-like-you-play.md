I have a confession to make: All day I sit at work and program computers,
then after work I go home and do the exact same thing. The programs I
write at work and at home are different (right now at work I'm writing
a beefy Django app with tons of client-site Backbone JavaScript, but at
home I'm learning Rails); but to the untrained eye it must look like I just
tap-tap-tap all my free time away.

Of course I wouldn't program in my free time unless I thought it was fun.
I pretty much *only* do things that I think are fun. Life's too
short to spend any time being miserable about what you do. Work is a different
kind of fun though; work is stressful and high-pressure. We have customers
that need features, we have bugs that need fixing *yesterday*.
Those factors that make it stressful are also the factors that make it
*rewarding.* I know that a good publish will make our users happier,
and that a bad push will make them sad.

Hacking a Rails app in my spare time is a different beast. Most of my time
is spent reading up on best-practices, reading entertaining blog posts by
characters in the Rails community, and reading the works of the venerable _why.
If I worked at a Rails shop would I still find it as fun? Maybe, maybe not.
Maybe that's not the point. I have more freedom to write bullet-proof high-quality
code, but if I delay my publish by 2 weeks nobody is going to care (or even notice!).

Does a lawyer finish work at the office and go home to work on slightly
different lawyer work? Does a doctor? What about a road-worker, a journalist,
a carpenter? I don't think so.

Who does keep working after hours? Artists. Musicians. Writers. Creators.
