A new blogger over at <a title="Encephalogue" href="http://encephalogue.blogspot.com/">Encephalogue</a>, Sean Patrick, has posted <a title="What's missing from the brain-computer analogy" href="http://encephalogue.blogspot.com/2008/12/whats-missing-from-brain-computer.html">his opinions</a> on the brain-computer analogy, one of the foundations of the cognitive sciences.

It's a solid read, a good introduction to the dialogue surrounding the mind-machine metaphor. Patrick argues that:
<blockquote>The biggest discovery in neuroscience won't be the anatomy of the brain, or the physiology of the neuron - it will be the information theory of the mind.</blockquote>
I<em> mostly</em> agree with this comment. The information processing properties of the brain are, indeed, the reason why we study the thing. Without data processing the brain is nothing more than a bunch of energy-hungry cells. In fact, one of the most hard-hitting criticisms of neuroscience in recent years has been that the field is <a title="Jeff Hawkin's on Neuroscience" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing.html">data</a> <a title="Redwood Neuroscience - Mission statement" href="https://redwood.berkeley.edu/wiki/Mission_and_Research">rich</a>, <a title="Computational Neuroscience" href="http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/about/abouttheoneuro.html">theory</a> <a title="General theory on complex neural ensembles" href="http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research.html">poor</a>. Where I disagree with Patrick is in the details---I feel that the physiology of neurons and the interactions between neuron populations together hold the key to the coveted information theory!

If a scientist had no understanding of how a computer works, fundamental to <em>gaining</em> that understanding is determining how transistors function; however, as any competent hardware engineer will tell you, understanding the transistor does <em>not</em> mean you understand a circuit! An engineer must <em>analyze</em> a circuit and reach conclusions based on the interactions of the circuit's elements. Extend the computer metaphor to the brain. We must devour physiological research about neurons, we must consume research about neural networks and maps. <em>Then</em> we can begin to theorize with any coherency about the information processing abilities of the brain.

However, I'm glad there are other rationalists like <a title="Encephalogue" href="http://encephalogue.blogspot.com/">Sean Patrick</a> out there---mystical interpretations of brain function are all too common.
