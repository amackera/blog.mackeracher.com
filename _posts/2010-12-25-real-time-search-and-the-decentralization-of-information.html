Often, in a spare moment alone with my laptop, I find myself watching TED talks. Today I watched a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/evan_williams_on_listening_to_twitter_users.html">nervous looking</a> Evan Williams talk about Twitter, how it grew out of a side project of another company, how they listened to their users in creating useful features such as the @reply.

While watching it struck me that real-time search is a monumental thing. Not just a cool distraction, but a paradigm shift in how we, as humans, might perceive ourselves. Previous to any kind of real-time search we depended on centralized media to deliver current events to us, and that same media would drop its own bias into the information payload. Now, with Twitter, we can disseminate important information instantly, globally, with no bias but our own. Twitter is the decentralization of information delivery.

People often compare Twitter to shouting into a vast emptiness, and at times it can seem that way; however, we aren't shouting into nothingness, we are shouting at the world. Real-time search is the tool that enables us to listen to what the world is saying.
