I've done some cleaning up around here. Notably, I've switched away from the awful
theme I had previously used for this blog, and I'm now using the
[Balzac](http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/) theme by Cole Townsend. It's a very nice,
clean theme that appealed to the minimalist in me.

A new intern at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com), a fellow who goes by [Ryan Seys](https://ryanseys.com/),
has just completed a fascinating experiment to commit to Github ever day for an extended
period of time (in his case, [177 days](https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/).
A lot of his commits went into his blog evidently, and that idea has inspired me to juice
up this tired thing again.

Writing long-form blog posts seems like a more constructive use of my time than posting
things to Facebook, and it gives me a chance to highlight and expose some of my open
source work. I'm going to try and post something once or twice a month, to get into
a regular, self-reflective habit.

Enjoy the new theme. The picture at the top of the page is from the dock at a cottage that
my family has visited every summer for the past 27 years.
