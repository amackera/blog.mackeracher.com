This is the first of a multi-part series on many of the basic algorithms often taught in introductory computer science classes. I realize that there are many good references for these algorithms (for instance <a title="List of algorithms - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms">Wikipedia</a>'s comprehensive list), but I'd like to have a compact, uniformly formatted list of my own and I thought I'd share it with anybody who has an interest! Today's topic will be...
<h4>Algorithm Analysis:</h4>
Given two algorithms, how can we tell which one is superior? One way would be to implement both and run them on the same hardware---but that is expensive and time consuming. It would be nice if we could analyze an algorithm mathematically to determine its properties. Not only will we be able to select between two competing algorithms, but having a technique will help answer any lingering questions about whether we have implemented an algorithm correctly and caught all the bugs.

Come to the rescue is <a title="Donald Knuth's Homepage" href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/">Professor Knuth</a>'s technique of asymptotic algorithm analysis.
