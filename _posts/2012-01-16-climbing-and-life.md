Recently I have started rock climbing. I'm pretty awful at it, but I'm making
solid progress the longer I keep at it the better I get. It's been a fun and
interesting process learning a new sport through the end of the summer and the
start of the fall. There's a whole vernacular of technical terms relating to
aspects of the sport; there's technique to learn, and muscles to build; there
are skills to develop like reading a route and understanding how to distribute
one's weight. Overall it's a very pleasing experience to take up something new
and carry through with it at least to an intermediate level.

It got me thinking about other hobbies I have on the go. For a long time the
only thing I really did was mess around with computers. I took a silent
pleasure in learning how to deploy a Django app, or compiling my own Linux
kernel. I still do these things, along with playing video games, but I'm
starting to find my focus wandering.
