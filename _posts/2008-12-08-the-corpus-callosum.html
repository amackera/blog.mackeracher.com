The intention behind this blog is to develop and discuss ideas related to the Cognitive Sciences. Potential topics include (but are not limited to): language acquisition and processing, artificial intelligence, computational simulation, consciousness, physiological psychology, philosophy of the mind, computation, and information theory. These are all topics that interest me greatly, and it is my hope that similar minded people will stumble across my writings and find them accessible and engaging.

The Split Brain refers to the outcome of a rare surgical technique called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosotomy">corpus callosotomy</a>. The patient undergoing surgery has some or all of his or her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum">corpus callosum</a> severed. The technique is used as a last resort to prevent seizures in serious cases of epilepsy. The corpus callosum is integral in the transmission of information between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Patients who have undergone a corpus callosotomy display curious behavior, the study of which lead to many advances in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">lateralization of brain function</a>. I have chosen this name for this blog since it reflects my broad interests. They are seemingly unconnected, yet holistically they are tied together in the interdisciplinary study of Cognitive Science, just as a split-brain patient has two distinct hemispheres, but remains a single conscious entity.

In the coming weeks I will post semi-regularly with my current meditations on some of the topics mentioned earlier. If anyone by chance stumbles across this blog and is interested, comments are welcome and encouraged!
