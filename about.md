I'm a computer programmer. I've been writing code since 2001, from operating
systems in C to distributed systems in Python and JavaScript. I am happy to
call Toronto, Canada my home. I'm the Chief Architect at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com).

I like Python, JavaScript, C, asynchronous programming, GNU/Linux (specifically
[ArchLinix](https://www.archlinux.org/)), and vim.

I like to read books, both technical and otherwise. Some of my favourite authors
are Herman Hesse, Isaav Asimov, Margaret Atwood, and Alan Moore. I also love
reading works of a philosophical nature (Descarte, Hobbes).
