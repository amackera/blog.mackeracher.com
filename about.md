I'm Anson MacKeracher, a computer programmer. I've been writing code since 2001, from operating
systems to compilers, to distributed systems in all manner of programming languages.
I'm the _Chief Architect_ at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com). I am happy to call Toronto,
Canada my home.

I like Python, JavaScript, C, asynchronous programming, GNU/Linux (specifically
[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)), and vim.

I like to read books, both technical and otherwise. Some of my favourite authors
are Herman Hesse, Isaac Asimov, Margaret Atwood, and Alan Moore. I also love
reading works of a philosophical nature (Descarte, Hobbes).

Feel free to shoot me an email
