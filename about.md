I'm Anson MacKeracher, a computer programmer. I've been writing code since 2001, from operating
systems to compilers to distributed systems, in a variety of programming languages.
I'm the _Chief Architect_ at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com).

I am happy to call Toronto my home.

I'm a founding member of the [Pirate Party of Canada](https://www.pirateparty.ca/)

I like Python, JavaScript, C, asynchronous programming, GNU/Linux (specifically
[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/)), vim, music production, philosophy, and
literature.

Most of my experience is in writing scalable distributed systems for the web.

I like to read books, both technical and otherwise. Some of my favourite authors
are Herman Hesse, Isaac Asimov, Margaret Atwood, and Alan Moore. I also love
reading works of a philosophical nature (Descarte, Hobbes). On the technical side,
I love Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (I probably re-read it
once a year), and Knuth's Art of Computer Programming. I'm still searching for a
great reference manual for distributed systems.

Feel free to shoot me an email at anson@mackeracher.com.
